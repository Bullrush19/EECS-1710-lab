Instructions:
When ran, there will first be a paralax background of the deep ocean and a fish in the 
top left side of the window. Soon a shark will start swimming from a random location on the 
right side of the screen to the left. If the fish is close to the shark it will swim away 
with a scared frowning face. once the shark swims off screen to the left 
a new shark will start to come starting the process over.
