Instructions:
When run, an image of an octopus in the ocean will appear. At the end of each of the octopus' tentacles,
there is a button. Each of the buttons are representative of one key in an octave. If you hover the mouse 
over one of the buttons. The colour will change from pink to red. When pressed by the
mouse they play the sound of the corresponding note in the octave.
