Instructions:

When the program is run you should see a screen with a blue background. When the user moves their mouse
over the screen, little coloured dots should start appearing where your mouse is. The user should then
keep moving their mouse back and forth across the screen to cover the blue background with dots.
The collection of dots should slowly start to look like an image of a pokeball.
