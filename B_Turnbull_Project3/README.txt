Instructions:
When ran, the program will draw an image of the pokemon typhlosion made up of 
a bunch of smaller images of pokemon. The images chosen are based on their brightness level.
If you can't make out the small images you can increase their size in the code by increasing the
scale value. For example, int scale = 24; will allow you to see each individual image fairly clearly while at
int scale = 2; it will just look like regular pixels.
