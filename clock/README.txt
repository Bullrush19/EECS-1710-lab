Bennett Turnbull - midterm

Instructions:
I made a clock that is meant to display when it is high tide and low tide. 

When it is high tide the clock face becomes dark blue. (11pm - 1am & 11am and 1pm)

When it is low tide the clock face becomes beige. (5am - 7am & 5pm to 7pm)

Inbetween these times the clock face is light blue. (1am - 5am, 7am - 11am, 1pm - 5pm, 7pm - 11pm)
